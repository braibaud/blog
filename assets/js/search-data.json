            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of Keras Tuner. This project is an attempt to use an LSTM based neural network (RNN) to forecast timeseries data. . The required libraries . Import the must-have libraries: . import numpy as np import pandas as pd import datetime as dt . Import the keras elements from the tensorflow library: . import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras as k from tensorflow.keras import backend as kb from tensorflow.keras import callbacks as kc from tensorflow.keras import models as km from tensorflow.keras import layers as kl from tensorflow.keras import regularizers as kr from tensorflow.keras import optimizers as ko from tensorflow.keras import utils as ku . Import the keras-tuner library as we&#39;ll use it to tune hyperparameters: . import kerastuner as kt from kerastuner import tuners as ktt . Import the mlviz library used to plot time-series visualizations: . from mlviz.timeseries import visualizationhelpers as mwvh from mlviz.utilities import graphichelpers as mwgh . The timeseries data . The input data is available in a csv file named 2021-05-31-LSTM timeseries forecasting with Keras Tuner-DATA.csv located in the data folder. It has got 2 columns date containing the date of event and value holding the value of the source. We&#39;ll rename these 2 columns as ds and y for convenience. Let&#39;s load the csv file using the pandas library and have a look at the data. . df = pd.read_csv( filepath_or_buffer=&#39;../assets/data/2021-05-31-LSTM timeseries forecasting with Keras Tuner-DATA.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;) df.rename( columns = { &#39;date&#39;: &#39;index&#39;, &#39;value&#39;: &#39;y&#39; }, inplace=True) df[&#39;index&#39;] = pd.to_datetime( arg=df[&#39;index&#39;], dayfirst=True) df.sort_values( by=&#39;index&#39;, ascending=True, inplace=True) df.set_index( keys=&#39;index&#39;, inplace=True) df = df.asfreq( freq=&#39;W-SAT&#39;) df[&#39;ds&#39;] = df.index print(&#39;df.shape = {0}&#39;.format(df.shape)) df.tail(5) . . df.shape = (625, 2) . y ds . index . 2019-09-28 5547 | 2019-09-28 | . 2019-10-05 6459 | 2019-10-05 | . 2019-10-12 5838 | 2019-10-12 | . 2019-10-19 5894 | 2019-10-19 | . 2019-10-26 7925 | 2019-10-26 | . Data preparation . Let&#39;s keep the fisrt 80% of the data for training and the last 20% for testing. The cutoff date would be as follow. . Cutoff date for training/testing split is 10/06/2017 . We can now split the dataframe into 2: . test_mask = (df[&#39;ds&#39;] &gt;= threshold_date) . df_train = df[~test_mask] print(&#39;df_train.shape = {0}&#39;.format(df_train.shape)) . df_train.shape = (500, 2) . df_test = df[test_mask] print(&#39;df_test.shape = {0}&#39;.format(df_test.shape)) . df_test.shape = (125, 2) .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .
